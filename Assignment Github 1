# i feel like if we want to look at misrepresented objects we can use

# that since they are so far away their light might not be that easy to 
# capture leading to not only physical limitations in gear, but lack of  
# good observations in the date due to other limitations. the sample should
# probably be big enough, is overfitting a problem ?
